# mem·o·ra·bil·i·a

mem·o·ra·bil·i·a is a full-stack mobile application for personal journaling. Users can log their thoughts and experiences on a daily basis using a voice memo, picture, video or a song on Spotify! It uses Expo and React Native for the front end and has a serverless backend using AWS Amplify (API, Auth & Storage)

# Inspo

When I was younger I refused to have pictures of me taken, so I don't have much to look back on, which is really sad😢. After seeing this tweet a while ago, I'm making an effort to take more pictures/videos of my daily life and keep a journal. But logging your life and how you feel can sometimes feel like a chore, which is why I decided to make an app that can make journaling slightly easier.

<ul>
  <li>Sometimes when I journal, I feel like my thoughts outpace my writing speed, so I added a voice memo functionality.</li>
   <li>I spend a lot of time on Spotify making playlists on my own or with friends. It's another way I use to document how I'm feeling and what I experience. For this reason, I used the Spotify API to allow users to log a song for their daily journal entry.</li>
    <li> The UI is also BeReal-esque.</li>
</ul>
